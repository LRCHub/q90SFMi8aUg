The weather, oh oh, the weather
Ruining our plans come on and get it together
You're so mean, so mean
The weather, oh oh, the weather
Waitin' for the sun
But it's not gettin' better
You're so mean, so mean
Yo, I don't miss the woolen
Jackets and the winter caps
Scratchy scarves, bulky boots, how everyday
My lips were chapped
My dermatologist a firm apologist
Of winter weather
I've used every type of cream and lip
Balm and I'm still not better
Aside from skin, i don't miss my itchy
Thermal sheep-skin socks
I've been waitin' since December
For the vernal equinox
And thankfully, it's here
No more drivin' through the permafrost
I don't need a coffee thermos
I can turn my furnace off
And note to self: I've been waitin' months
For all this snow to melt
And finally, it's gone
And I can venture out of our room
Frolic in the foliage
Kick back and watch the flowers bloom
And breathe the open air as the
Heavens shine bright and powder blue
There's just one little problem though
That I didn't account for:
Every fuckin' weather forecast has
A chance of downpour
Just one little issue, and yes
I'm a bit impatient
But I haven't waited all this
Time for more precipitation
Like weather gods
There's just one little thought
I'm tryna get across
I don't expect things perfect
But at least just give me better odds
Lately, I've been hopin' that the
Tones of grey would fade
And that the sky would yawn cerulean
Not rain on my parade
And I know I'm bein' harsh on you
But I'm not tryna scapegoat
It'd just be nice to go
Outside without wearing a raincoat
Without holdin' umbrellas
The sidewalk nice and chalky
With no puddles there to waddle through
Wearing nothing waterproof
But maybe on the bright side, it's a fair bet
To think the sun is over on her way here
But not here yet
So let's go get our hair wet, fuck it
Let's go dancing in our bare feet
On a rooftop super carefree
With the pattering
Of the dew drops as our jukebox
And run for cover at a nearby coffee shop
Where we can dry our parka
And our rubberized galoshes off
And we'll just take a rain-check for
That picnic in the grass
And sip our lattes by the window
As the drizzle hit's the glass
The weather, oh oh, the weather
Ruining our plans come on and get it together
You're so mean, so mean
The weather, oh oh, the weather
Waitin' for the sun
But it's not gettin' better
You're so mean, so mean
Okay, so I'm feelin' like I took
A bit to see the light
Routinely stayed inside so I could
Keep a peace of mind
But now I stay in fright of
White little sparkles in the air
And while I'm waitin' for the showers
Seems these months are ever there
They never go away, but sit complacent
Where as I'm wishin' I
Could see the pavement, latent hatin'
On the continents that feel the burn when
School is out and tables turn
The skin hurts and things
Are said that because
The heat just makes you think to
But despite the fact it truly makes
You think about the people
And I'm prayin' to a
Deity, 'cause recently
This weather has me overweight
The perfect time for dates
But yet we're snowed in in our place
And it gets cold out when
It's late, so baby
Don't forget the blankets
And reminiscin' and dreamin' can keep us
Warm for just a while but darlin'
Won't you turn the thermostat right
Up to winter dial?
We can hibernate to skip our
Fate, jump to summer, first comes spring
But don't forget the droplets and
The storming it might bring i'm exhausted
I'm just wonder when I'll
Feel the rays again
Maybe never will I see the sun
Or things that are akin
And yet these Google images will only
Get me oh so far
And yes, my thinkin' may be screwed
I know my thoughts may be bizarre
I greet these trials with a smile and grin
For whatever reason
I can keep my calm and know that you'll
Be there for the seasons that I hate
You could help me hold on so
That I could bear the wait
It's understated just as much on
How these seasons overplayed, yeah
We could stay inside together
You and I in matching sweaters
And though it may just be forever
Me and you could beat the weather oh, I know
That summertime is overdue but I know
I can make it, girl
As long as it's with you
The weather, oh oh, the weather
Ruining our plans come on and get it together
You're so mean, so mean
The weather, oh oh, the weather
Waitin' for the sun
But it's not gettin' better
You're so mean, so mean
