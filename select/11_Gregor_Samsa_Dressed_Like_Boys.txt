There's a black hole in the living room
Grabbing hold of my chair
cnd the plants and the sunlight in your hair
There's a black hole walking next to me
Grabbing onto my friend
cnd the owner of the book store
With the cockroach on the window
Gregor Samsa
Goodnight, black hole
There's a black hole in my memory
It was already there
Born in the sunlight in your hair
There's a black hole sitting at the bar
Buys me a drink
cnd I drink and it starts laughing
Like a hollowed out jukebox in the snow
Fifteen feet of snow
Goodnight, black hole
Black hole in the living room
